## Introduction

**MGC** (Memory Game Card) is a web-based memory game designed for entertainment and frontend learning purposes.

The game challenges players to match pairs of cards while tracking scores and game states. It is structured as a single-page application using AngularJS 1.x, and includes animated transitions and modular routing for a fluid user experience.

The project was built to showcase:

- SPA routing with Angular UI-Router
- Component-based architecture in AngularJS
- Use of factories for game logic (cards, sound, score)
- A visually engaging and responsive UI

---

## Key Features

- **Interactive Memory Game:** Match card pairs with animations and win logic.
- **Componentized Architecture:** Game views and logic separated into modular AngularJS components.
- **Stateful Routing:** Navigation through UI-Router states (main, play, win, about).
- **Sound Feedback:** Integrated sound effects on actions and victory.
- **Score Tracking:** Track and display score across sessions.
- **Cordova Integration:** Project structure and config prepared for mobile deployment with Apache Cordova.
- **Gulp Dev Server:** Optional live-reloading setup with linting for development.
